# Java-HTTP-Server
This program is a small HTTP 1.0 server that I had to make as a homework

This program can handle GET, HEAD and POST requests. It was a homework for the subject Computer Networks.

The result is 90%, because it hasn't got a Logger class, and the default pages (like 404) aren't in a HTML file but in the code.
